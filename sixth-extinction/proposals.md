## Proposals

Looking into the various species that human activity has killed is overwhelming: Frogs, Coral, The West African Black Rhinoceros, Hawaian Crows, Pyrenean Ibexes, Passenger Pigeons, Quagga, Caribbean Monk Seals, Sea Minks, Javan Tigers, and not to mention the countless flora around the globe.  

To think of a cohesive proposals that encompase the enormity of this exinction is as futile of a task as denying there even is an extinction.  Instead, I want to think about extinction and hopelessness as a general concept deeply rooted in the science of our current geological era.  

While doing research two things jumped out at me as topics I would enjoy spending time researching:

### The Loss of the Future Anterior 

The future anterior tense — the tense used to describe an action that will finish in the future —  loss of the future anterior perhaps suggis fading away from everyday speech. This observation, to me, seemed incredibly poetic. What does it signal? Is this symptomatic that deep our psyche we have lost faith in the future - lost faith in our ability to effect change - lost our ability to imagine a better future.  

I want to think of a research methedology to explore this phenomena as it relates to the sixth extinction. Ideas could include:

1. Twitter Bot to scrape instances of the future anterior tweeted in real time. 
2. Research into its usage across the internet.
3. A campaign to more activley reintegrate it into political speech.



### Labeling Radioactive Waste

I have spent a lot of time thinking about the geolical legacy of war technology.  To me, this concept is no better illustrated than in the craters left in Nevada from Atomic Weapons Test, and in the storage sites of radioactive waste. This waste forces politicians to confront policy with a non-electoral timeline that stretches far beyond their electoral tenure and into the futures of the great great great great grandchildren.  In my last blog post I wrote about how DOE scientists have imagined future societies in order to signal to them the dangers of nuclear storage facilities.  This poison will last longer than humans and will be a dangerous relic of our society to future worlds. How can I explore the concept of radioactive waste from the lense of a future society stumbling across our world as an archaeologist?

1. Can I recreate the proposed DOE earth works in VR?  Is this interesting?
2.   
3.   

### Potential Experts I'd like to speak to:

Sonia N. Das ( NYU ) Research/Interest: Linguistic anthropology, semiotics, language contact, heritage language, infrastructure, migration/mobility, diasporic Tamils, francophone Québec, colonial French India, Indian seafarers

More to come
