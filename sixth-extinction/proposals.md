## Proposals

Looking into the various species that human activity has killed is overwhelming: Frogs, Coral, The West African Black Rhinoceros
, Hawaian Crows, Pyrenean Ibexes, Passenger Pigeons, Quagga, Caribbean Monk Seals, Sea Minks, Javan Tigers, and not to mention the countless flora around the globe.
To think of a cohesive proposals that encompase the enormity of this exinction is as futile of a task as denying there even is an extinction.  
Instead, I want to think about extinction and hopelessness as a general concept deeply rooted in the science of our current geological era.
