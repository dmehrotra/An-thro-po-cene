## Thoughts 2-11:

Extinction as a concept has entered cultural consciousness.  It's in movies that lean on planetary destruction and in TV Shows about the disapearence of humans.  The continutiy and success of this content proves the market, and the market proves its existence in capitalist society.  My question is what is capital's response to extinction?  If we frame extinction as an attack on the commons and an attack on the potential for human wealth, then extinction becomes more than the death of a species -- the 
death of the system. Two popular responses are rewilding and de-extinction.  Both envision techno-utopian market-driven solutions to address an environmental catastophe created by the same sort of capitalism.  As Miriam Tola says " It is not simply that de-extinction draws attention—and economic resources—away from other efforts to conserve biodiversity as it currently exists. The fundamental problem with de-extinction is that it relies on the thoroughgoing manipulation and commodification of nature, and as such dovetails perfectly with biocapitalism." Are we so entrenched in a system of markets that we are unable to alternative ways to address climate change?  

Talk like this is often dismissed as impractical: "You have to work within the system to produce real results". I don't have an answer here, but this feels like another discouraging thought to add to my collection of discouraging thoughts.   

These thoughts come from Arun Saldanha (University of Minnesota), “Capital, extinction, race: Undead as a dodo” and Miriam Tola (Rutgers University), “The Extinction of Species-Being”.  

## About The Loss of the Future Anterior

I've been doing some more research about language death leading up to a proposal for next week...but all of my research is leading me to historical cases of language loss due to assimilation or conquest.  Im not sure how useful this is for the poetic comparison im trying to employ -> That the extinction of this tense is a product of the sixth extinction.  A human lack of ability to imagine the future.  Poetically enough this tense is also referred to as the Future Perfect.
