## Enter the Anthropocen

I love Elizabeth Kolbert.  I recently read her piece in the New Yorker about The Sixth Extinction and the mass dying of a species of frogs.  

What I liked about this piece has to do more with the politics of defining a geolical period than the horror of what this means. First, from a geological perspective, what are the most visible human effects on the landscape? Though cities seem like an obvious marker of human existence, they donâ€™t leave necessary traces due to erosion. The answer to this question, very clearly, seems to be carbon dioxide emissions.  Thinking about human impact on this time scale provides a terrifying perspective into the very question. 

That the anthropocene is here seems obvious, yet there are clear politics involved for the scientific community to come to this determination. The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is tasked with making the call about whether to officiate the term. "A final decision on the matter will require votes both by the ICS and its parent organization, the International Union of Geological Sciences".  

The acidification of oceans to the point that coral can no longer construct reefs have marked five recorded extinction.    
As the ICS argues over nomanclature the great barrier reef has stopped growing.
